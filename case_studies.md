CAIO grounds its methodology and validation in four prototypical domains. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

## Navigation services
How do route suggestions redistribute traffic? What feedback loops arise when large populations follow algorithmic routing? :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

## Ride-hailing and ride-sharing
Do these platforms improve mobility options for underserved areas or reinforce existing inequalities? How do they affect congestion, accessibility, and public transport usage? :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

## House renting platforms
How do rental recommendations influence demand, prices, and the risk of gentrification and displacement? :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

## Location-based recommendations (POIs)
