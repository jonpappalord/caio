CAIO grounds its methodology and validation in four prototypical domains.

## Navigation services
How do route suggestions redistribute traffic? What feedback loops arise when large populations follow algorithmic routing?

## Ride-hailing and ride-sharing
Do these platforms improve mobility options for underserved areas or reinforce existing inequalities? How do they affect congestion, accessibility, and public transport usage?

## House renting platforms
How do rental recommendations influence demand, prices, and the risk of gentrification and displacement?

## Location-based recommendations (POIs)
Do some venues gain disproportionate visibility, fostering economic concentration? Does personalization lead to spatial segregation of leisure choices?
