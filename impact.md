CAIO aims to generate impact at multiple levels by advancing scientific understanding of city–AI coevolution and by informing the design and governance of AI-driven urban services.

## Scientific impact
CAIO introduces a unified framework to study *human–AI feedback loops* in urban contexts, bridging AI, complexity science, and urban analytics. By combining empirical studies, mechanistic modelling, and large-scale simulations, the project advances the state of the art in understanding how individual-level algorithmic recommendations can give rise to collective, system-level outcomes.

Key scientific contributions include:
- New empirical evidence on the short-, medium-, and long-term effects of AI-driven recommenders on mobility, congestion, emissions, and inequality.
- Mechanistic models of city–AI coevolution that extend classic mobility and segregation models to incorporate algorithmic decision-making and continual retraining.
- Conceptual and methodological advances for studying feedback loops between individuals and AI systems in complex socio-technical environments.

## Societal and policy impact
AI-driven services increasingly influence access to urban resources, from mobility options to housing and leisure opportunities. CAIO provides tools and evidence to support informed policy-making by identifying when algorithmic interventions improve urban efficiency and inclusion, and when they risk amplifying congestion, segregation, or inequality.

The project contributes to:
- Evidence-based evaluation of AI-driven urban services for policymakers and city administrations.
- Conceptual frameworks to align AI system design with collective urban goals such as sustainability, accessibility, and fairness.
- Public understanding of the opportunities and risks associated with algorithmically mediated urban life.

## Technological impact
CAIO goes beyond descriptive analysis by exploring *complexity-informed AI recommenders* that explicitly account for system-level effects. These approaches aim to balance individual preferences with collective objectives by incorporating global metrics (e.g., congestion, emissions, segregation) and adaptive constraints into recommendation processes.

Expected technological outcomes include:
- Design principles for AI-driven recommenders operating in complex urban environments. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Open-source software, simulation tools, and benchmark scenarios to support reproducible research and comparative evaluation. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Integration of CAIO outputs within existing research infrastructures, including SoBigData.eu. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Long-term impact
By framing cities as coevolving human–AI systems, CAIO contributes to a longer-term shift in how AI is designed, evaluated, and governed in society. The project lays the groundwork for future research and innovation aimed at ensuring that AI-driven urban services remain transparent, accountable, and aligned with societal values. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
