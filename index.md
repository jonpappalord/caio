<strong>CAIO</strong> (City–AI Coevolution) studies how AI-driven services—navigation, ride-hailing, house renting, and location-based recommenders—co-adapt with urban environments through feedback loops.
</div>

## What is City–AI Coevolution?
AI-driven recommendations influence mobility and urban dynamics; individuals’ choices generate the data that retrain recommenders, which then steer future choices—creating a feedback loop that can amplify both benefits and unintended consequences for cities. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Objectives
<div class="grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Understand</h3>
    <p>Measure short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of AI-driven recommenders on mobility, sustainability, and inequality, and their interplay with urban policies.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Develop mechanistic models of the city–AI feedback loop by extending established mobility and segregation frameworks to include AI-driven recommendations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Govern</h3>
    <p>Design complexity-informed recommenders that balance individual goals with collective urban objectives within an ethical and transparent framework.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Case studies
CAIO grounds its research in four domains: (i) navigation services, (ii) ride-hailing/sharing, (iii) house renting platforms, and (iv) location-based recommendations (e.g., points of interest). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
