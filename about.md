CAIO (*City–AI Coevolution*) is a 60-month research project hosted at the Italian National Research Council (CNR).

### Motivation
AI-driven services increasingly shape urban life. For example, navigation apps can reroute traffic onto local streets, potentially producing severe congestion in neighborhoods not designed for large flows. Similar dynamics appear in ride-hailing, house-renting, and location-based recommenders, affecting accessibility, sustainability, and inequality.

### The core idea
CAIO studies the *city–AI feedback loop*: recommenders provide suggestions (routes, trips, houses, POIs) that influence individual choices; these choices generate training data that retrain the recommender, which then updates future suggestions—reshaping urban dynamics over time.

### What CAIO delivers
- Empirical and simulation-based evidence about the impacts of AI-driven recommenders on cities.
- Mechanistic models of city–AI coevolution (from analytically tractable models to agent-based simulations).
- Complexity-informed recommenders that explicitly incorporate systemic metrics (e.g., congestion, emissions, segregation) and ethical constraints.
- Open science outputs: software, data, best practices, and integration within SoBigData.eu.
