CAIO is organized into five Work Packages (WPs) that interact iteratively across the project.

## WP1 — Understanding city–AI coevolution
Measure the impact of AI-driven recommenders on urban dynamics and policies across time scales, combining observational studies, controlled interventions/quasi-experiments, and digital-twin simulations when platform access is limited.

## WP2 — Modelling city–AI coevolution
Develop mechanistic models by extending classic frameworks (e.g., mobility models and segregation models) to account for AI-driven recommendations and continual retraining.

## WP3 — Governing city–AI coevolution
Design complexity-informed recommenders that balance individual and collective goals by embedding systemic metrics (congestion, emissions, segregation), adaptive parameters, continual learning, and interpretable layers.

## WP4 — Case studies
Validate methods and models across four real-world domains: navigation, ride-hailing/sharing, house renting, and location-based recommendations.

## WP5 — Open science and dissemination
Publish results in leading venues, release open-source tools and data under FAIR principles, integrate outputs into SoBigData.eu, and engage policymakers and the public through events and creative collaborations (including art/author residencies).
